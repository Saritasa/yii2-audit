# Javascript Logging

The module also supports logging of javascript errors, warnings and even regular log entries.
To activate, register the `\bedezign\yii2\audit\web\JSLoggingAsset` in any of your views:

```php
\bedezign\yii2\audit\web\JSLoggingAsset::register($this);
```

This will activate the logger automatically. By default all warnings and errors are transmitted to the backend.

This means that the javascript will need an URL to submit its data to.   
Usually the module can automatically determine what URL to use. 

Should the auto detection fail you can correct the url by updating the setting somewhere in your javascript:

```javascript
window.auditUrl = '/mymodulename/javascript/log';
``` 

(Please also open an issue so we can figure out why the auto-detection failed and hopefully fix it)

## What is logged?

The module works by overriding `window.onerror`. Everything that arrives there is logged. That functionality is active out of the box. This is triggered on for example syntax errors in your javascript. 

### How to test?

Just introduce a syntax error in your script (forget to close a bracket or something). A logentry should be created.

```javscript
function test(){
```


## Logging yourself

The component is available as `window.jsLogger` and provides several functions for custo logging.  
By default the functions also call the console, so you still see the messages there. Available functions are `window.jsLogger.info()`, `window.jsLogger.log()`, `window.jsLogger.warn()` and `window.jsLogger.error()`. All functions accept a `message` and optional data (object) to attach. 

Unlike the console functions jsLogger doesn't accept multiple parameters to output at once. If you need it, feel free to create a PR to add the functionality. 

If you do not want the `console`-functions to be called, set the `consoleOutput` to `false`:

```javascript
window.jsLogger.consoleOutput = false;
```

## Remarks
* All logging you perform that originates from that page load will be linked to the same entry in the database. If you should need the current entry id for other things, it is added to the `window`-object as `window.auditEntry`.
* If you use ajax or related technologies to load data from the backend, these requests might generate their own audit entries. Any errors that these cause will be linked to that newly created entry. Might be confusing, given that the actual client side logging for these requests will still be linked to the original one.
